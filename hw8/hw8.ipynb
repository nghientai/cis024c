    "\n",
    "1. You can add a new cell by clicking on the \"+\" icon on top.\n",
    "2. You can delete a cell by selecting that cell and clicking on the \"scissors\" icon on top.\n",
    "3. You can execute a cell by either pressing shift+enter or selecting the \"play\" button on top.\n",
    "4. You can create a new file in Jupyter via the File menu->New Notebook option. Make sure to select Python 2 when creating your notebook.\n",
    "5. Also, for your code blocks make sure that Code is selected instead of another option like Markdown.\n",
    "6. Use the Enter key to go to the next line in a cell to enter the next statement.\n",
    "7. You can clear results by clicking on the Cell menu item and selecting Current Output->Clear or All Output->Clear depending on whether you are trying to just clear the output for one cell or for all cells.\n",
    "8. In case your program has crashed for some reason (infinite loop, for example), you can restart your Python session by select Kernel in the menu and selecting Restart.\n"

Down the Rabbit-Hole\\n\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the\\nbook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\\nit, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and what is the use of a book,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice \\xe2\\x80\\x98without pictures or\\nconversations?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\\nof making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\nclose by her.\\n\\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\\nVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh dear!\\nOh dear! I shall be late!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (when she thought it over afterwards, it\\noccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\\nit all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\\nOUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\\nAlice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\\nnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\\nto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\\nafter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\\nrabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\\nwell.\\n\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\\ngoing to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what\\nshe was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\\nshe passed; it was labelled \\xe2\\x80\\x98ORANGE MARMALADE\\xe2\\x80\\x99, but to her great\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\nof killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\\nshe fell past it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98after such a fall as this, I shall\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll all think me at\\nhome! Why, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top\\nof the house!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Which was very likely true.)\\n\\nDown, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! \\xe2\\x80\\x98I wonder how\\nmany miles I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fallen by this time?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said aloud. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I must be getting\\nsomewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\\nthousand miles down, I think--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\\nthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\\nwas not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\\nwas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--yes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\\nor Longitude I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or\\nLongitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\\n\\nPresently she began again. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the\\nearth! How funny it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll seem to come out among the people that walk with\\ntheir heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (she was rather glad\\nthere WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sound at all the\\nright word) \\xe2\\x80\\x98--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country\\nis, you know. Please, Ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (and\\nshe tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re falling\\nthrough the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \\xe2\\x80\\x98And what an\\nignorant little girl she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll think me for asking! No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never do to\\nask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\ntalking again. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Dinah\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n(Dinah was the cat.) \\xe2\\x80\\x98I hope they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll remember her saucer of milk at\\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\\nmice in the air, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very\\nlike a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And here Alice\\nbegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy\\nsort of way, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and sometimes, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do\\nbats eat cats?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for, you see, as she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer either question,\\nit didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\\noff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\\nDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:\\ndid you ever eat a bat?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon\\na heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\\n\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.\\nThere was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and\\nwas just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh my ears\\nand whiskers, how late it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She was close behind it when she\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\nfrom the roof.\\n\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\nget out again.\\n\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\n\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\\nthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\\nthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\\ndoorway; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and even if my head would go through,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought poor Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\nwould be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\\nshut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nFor, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\\nthat Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\\nimpossible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\ntime she found a little bottle on it, [\\xe2\\x80\\x98which certainly was not here\\nbefore,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\nlabel, with the words \\xe2\\x80\\x98DRINK ME\\xe2\\x80\\x99 beautifully printed on it in large\\nletters.\\n\\nIt was all very well to say \\xe2\\x80\\x98Drink me,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but the wise little Alice was\\nnot going to do THAT in a hurry. \\xe2\\x80\\x98No, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll look first,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and\\nsee whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoison\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or not\\xe2\\x80\\x99; for she had read several nice\\nlittle histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\\nbeasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\\nthe simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\\npoker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\\nforgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \\xe2\\x80\\x98poison,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it is\\nalmost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\\n\\nHowever, this bottle was NOT marked \\xe2\\x80\\x98poison,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 so Alice ventured to taste\\nit, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\\nof cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\\nbuttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What a curious feeling!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I must be shutting up like a\\ntelescope.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\nshe felt a little nervous about this; \\xe2\\x80\\x98for it might end, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said\\nAlice to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder\\nwhat I should be like then?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And she tried to fancy what the flame of a\\ncandle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\\never having seen such a thing.\\n\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\nsat down and cried.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use in crying like that!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice to herself,\\nrather sharply; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I advise you to leave off this minute!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She generally\\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use now,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought poor Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98to pretend to be two people!\\nWhy, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98EAT ME\\xe2\\x80\\x99 were beautifully marked in currants. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll eat it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said\\nAlice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\nget into the garden, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care which happens!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Which way? Which\\nway?\\xe2\\x80\\x99, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\\nin the common way.\\n\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Curiouser and curiouser!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \\xe2\\x80\\x98now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\nsight, they were getting so far off). \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder\\nwho will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure\\n_I_ shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be\\nkind to them,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98or perhaps they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t walk the way I want\\nto go! Let me see: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \\xe2\\x80\\x98They must\\ngo by the carrier,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she thought; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and how funny it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll seem, sending\\npresents to one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\n\\n     ALICE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\\n       HEARTHRUG,\\n         NEAR THE FENDER,\\n           (WITH ALICE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S LOVE).\\n\\nOh dear, what nonsense I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\n\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98a great girl like\\nyou,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (she might well say this), \\xe2\\x80\\x98to go on crying in this way! Stop this\\nmoment, I tell you!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of\\ntears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches\\ndeep and reaching half down the hall.\\n\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in\\none hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great\\nhurry, muttering to himself as he came, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!\\nOh! won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t she be savage if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve kept her waiting!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice felt so\\ndesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98If you please, sir--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nThe Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,\\nand skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\n\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Dear, dear! How\\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\nI wonder if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a\\nlittle different. But if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not the same, the next question is, Who\\nin the world am I? Ah, THAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S the great puzzle!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And she began thinking\\nover all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to\\nsee if she could have been changed for any of them.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not Ada,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98for her hair goes in such long\\nringlets, and mine doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go in ringlets at all; and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\nvery little! Besides, SHE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S she, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m I, and--oh dear, how puzzling\\nit all is! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me\\nsee: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and\\nfour times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!\\nHowever, the Multiplication Table doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t signify: let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s try Geography.\\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and\\nRome--no, THAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S all wrong, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m certain! I must have been changed for\\nMabel! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll try and say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow doth the little--\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and she crossed her\\nhands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,\\nbut her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the\\nsame as they used to do:--\\n\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x98How doth the little crocodile\\n      Improve his shining tail,\\n     And pour the waters of the Nile\\n      On every golden scale!\\n\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x98How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\n      How neatly spread his claws,\\n     And welcome little fishes in\\n      With gently smiling jaws!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure those are not the right words,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said poor Alice, and her eyes\\nfilled with tears again as she went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I must be Mabel after all, and\\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nmade up my mind about it; if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Mabel, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stay down here! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be no\\nuse their putting their heads down and saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome up again, dear!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I\\nshall only look up and say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho am I then? Tell me that first, and then,\\nif I like being that person, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come up: if not, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stay down here\\ntill I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m somebody else\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--but, oh dear!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried Alice, with a sudden burst\\nof tears, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired\\nof being all alone here!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little white kid gloves while\\nshe was talking. \\xe2\\x80\\x98How CAN I have done that?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I must\\nbe growing small again.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She got up and went to the table to measure\\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now\\nabout two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found\\nout that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped\\nit hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That WAS a narrow escape!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and\\nnow for the garden!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and she ran with all speed back to the little door:\\nbut, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was\\nlying on the glass table as before, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and things are worse than ever,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nthought the poor child, \\xe2\\x80\\x98for I never was so small as this before, never!\\nAnd I declare it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too bad, that it is!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\\nshe was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she\\nhad somehow fallen into the sea, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and in that case I can go back by\\nrailway,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon\\nmade out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\\nwas nine feet high.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I wish I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cried so much!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\nto find her way out. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!\\nHowever, everything is queer to-day.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\nslipped in like herself.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Would it be of any use, now,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98to speak to this mouse?\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no harm in trying.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So she\\nbegan: \\xe2\\x80\\x98O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Alice thought this must be the right\\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\nshe remembered having seen in her brother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Latin Grammar, \\xe2\\x80\\x98A mouse--of\\na mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!\\xe2\\x80\\x99) The Mouse looked at her rather\\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\nbut it said nothing.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Perhaps it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand English,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I daresay it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (For, with all\\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ou est ma chatte?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which\\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, I beg your pardon!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt\\nthe poor animal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I quite forgot you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like cats.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not like cats!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Would\\nYOU like cats if you were me?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, perhaps not,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice in a soothing tone: \\xe2\\x80\\x98don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be angry\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet\\nthing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the\\npool, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\\nwashing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsuch a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried\\nAlice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she\\nfelt certain it must be really offended. \\xe2\\x80\\x98We won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about her any\\nmore if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather not.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98We indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\ntail. \\xe2\\x80\\x98As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED\\ncats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let me hear the name again!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\nconversation. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 The Mouse did not\\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: \\xe2\\x80\\x98There is such a nice little dog near\\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fetch things when\\nyou throw them, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\nof things--I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,\\nyou know, and he says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so useful, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth a hundred pounds! He\\nsays it kills all the rats and--oh dear!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried Alice in a sorrowful\\ntone, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve offended it again!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 For the Mouse was swimming\\naway from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\\nthe pool as it went.\\n\\nSo she called softly after it, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like them!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 When the\\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\\nface was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\ntrembling voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Let us get to the shore, and then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you my\\nhistory, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,\\na Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\\nway, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\\n\\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\\nto Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\\nknown them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the\\nLory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I am older than\\nyou, and must know better\\xe2\\x80\\x99; and this Alice would not allow without\\nknowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its\\nage, there was no more to be said.\\n\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\ncalled out, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99LL soon make you\\ndry enough!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse\\nin the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt\\nsure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Ahem!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mouse with an important air, \\xe2\\x80\\x98are you all ready? This\\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWilliam\\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\\nMercia and Northumbria--\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Ugh!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Lory, with a shiver.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I beg your pardon!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Did\\nyou speak?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not I!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Lory hastily.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I thought you did,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mouse. \\xe2\\x80\\x98--I proceed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEdwin and Morcar,\\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\\nthe patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Found WHAT?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duck.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Found IT,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mouse replied rather crossly: \\xe2\\x80\\x98of course you know what\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I know what \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d means well enough, when I find a thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the\\nDuck: \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\narchbishop find?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x9c--found\\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\\ncrown. William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his\\nNormans--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d How are you getting on now, my dear?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it continued, turning\\nto Alice as it spoke.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98As wet as ever,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice in a melancholy tone: \\xe2\\x80\\x98it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to\\ndry me at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98In that case,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I move\\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\nremedies--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Speak English!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Eaglet. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the meaning of half\\nthose long words, and, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe you do either!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And\\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\\ntittered audibly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What I was going to say,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dodo in an offended tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x98was, that\\nthe best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What IS a Caucus-race?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,\\nbut the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,\\nand no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dodo, \\xe2\\x80\\x98the best way to explain it is to do it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (And, as\\nyou might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell\\nyou how the Dodo managed it.)\\n\\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, [\\xe2\\x80\\x98the exact\\nshape doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it said,) and then all the party were placed\\nalong the course, here and there. There was no \\xe2\\x80\\x98One, two, three, and\\naway,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,\\nthe Dodo suddenly called out \\xe2\\x80\\x98The race is over!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and they all crowded\\nround it, panting, and asking, \\xe2\\x80\\x98But who has won?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,\\nand it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead\\n(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures\\nof him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But who is to give the prizes?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 quite a chorus of voices asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why, SHE, of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;\\nand the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused\\nway, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Prizes! Prizes!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one\\na-piece all round.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But she must have a prize herself, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mouse.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Dodo replied very gravely. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What else have you got in\\nyour pocket?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he went on, turning to Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Only a thimble,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice sadly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hand it over here,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dodo.\\n\\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\\npresented the thimble, saying \\xe2\\x80\\x98We beg your acceptance of this elegant\\nthimble\\xe2\\x80\\x99; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\\n\\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she\\ncould.\\n\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You promised to tell me your history, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and why\\nit is you hate--C and D,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\nwould be offended again.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Mine is a long and a sad tale!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\nsighing.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It IS a long tail, certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, looking down with wonder at\\nthe Mouse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tail; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but why do you call it sad?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And she kept on puzzling\\nabout it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was\\nsomething like this:--\\n\\n         \\xe2\\x80\\x98Fury said to a\\n         mouse, That he\\n        met in the\\n       house,\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us\\n      both go to\\n       law: I will\\n        prosecute\\n         YOU.--Come,\\n           I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take no\\n           denial; We\\n          must have a\\n        trial: For\\n      really this\\n     morning I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\n    nothing\\n    to do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n      Said the\\n      mouse to the\\n       cur, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch\\n        a trial,\\n         dear Sir,\\n            With\\n          no jury\\n        or judge,\\n       would be\\n      wasting\\n      our\\n      breath.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be\\n        judge, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\n         be jury,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n             Said\\n         cunning\\n          old Fury:\\n          \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\n          try the\\n            whole\\n            cause,\\n              and\\n           condemn\\n           you\\n          to\\n           death.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You are not attending!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mouse to Alice severely. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What are you\\nthinking of?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I beg your pardon,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice very humbly: \\xe2\\x80\\x98you had got to the fifth\\nbend, I think?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I had NOT!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98A knot!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\nanxiously about her. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, do let me help to undo it!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I shall do nothing of the sort,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mouse, getting up and walking\\naway. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You insult me by talking such nonsense!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean it!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pleaded poor Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so easily offended,\\nyou know!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Please come back and finish your story!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice called after it; and the\\nothers all joined in chorus, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, please do!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but the Mouse only shook\\nits head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What a pity it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite\\nout of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her\\ndaughter \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\nYOUR temper!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hold your tongue, Ma!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the young Crab, a little\\nsnappishly. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice aloud, addressing\\nnobody in particular. \\xe2\\x80\\x98She\\xe2\\x80\\x99d soon fetch it back!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the\\nLory.\\n\\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Dinah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our cat. And she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a capital one for catching mice you\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\\nshe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\\ncarefully, remarking, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I really must be getting home; the night-air\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suit my throat!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to\\nits children, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Come away, my dears! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high time you were all in bed!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nOn various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I wish I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mentioned Dinah!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to herself in a melancholy\\ntone. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best\\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\\nany more!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard\\na little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming\\nback to finish his story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\n\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\\nit muttering to itself \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\\nmy fur and whiskers! She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\nferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice guessed in a\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,\\nand she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\\nnowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\\nthe pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\\nhad vanished completely.\\n\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing\\nout here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\\nQuick, now!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\\nin the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it\\nhad made.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98He took me for his housemaid,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to herself as she ran. \\xe2\\x80\\x98How\\nsurprised he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better take him\\nhis fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 As she said this, she\\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\nplate with the name \\xe2\\x80\\x98W. RABBIT\\xe2\\x80\\x99 engraved upon it. She went in without\\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\nfan and gloves.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How queer it seems,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice said to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98to be going messages for\\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be sending me on messages next!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And she\\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMiss Alice! Come\\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComing in a minute,\\nnurse! But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to see that the mouse doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Only I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nthink,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d let Dinah stop in the house if it\\nbegan ordering people about like that!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs\\nof tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,\\nand was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little\\nbottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time\\nwith the words \\xe2\\x80\\x98DRINK ME,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\\nto her lips. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said\\nto herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just see what\\nthis bottle does. I do hope it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make me grow large again, for really\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\ndown the bottle, saying to herself \\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite enough--I hope I shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ngrow any more--As it is, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ndrunk quite so much!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \\xe2\\x80\\x98Now I\\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It was much pleasanter at home,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought poor Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98when one wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\\nyet--it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\nCAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\\nkind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\\nThere ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I\\ngrow up, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll write one--but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m grown up now,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she added in a sorrowful\\ntone; \\xe2\\x80\\x98at least there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no room to grow up any more HERE.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But then,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98shall I NEVER get any older than I am\\nnow? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\\nthen--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like THAT!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, you foolish Alice!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she answered herself. \\xe2\\x80\\x98How can you learn\\nlessons in here? Why, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all\\nfor any lesson-books!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\\nquite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\\na voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Fetch me my gloves this moment!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\\nas the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\n\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s elbow was pressed hard against it,\\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \\xe2\\x80\\x98Then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\ngo round and get in at the window.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98THAT you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\n\\nNext came an angry voice--the Rabbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s--\\xe2\\x80\\x98Pat! Pat! Where are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sure then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here! Digging\\nfor apples, yer honour!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Digging for apples, indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Rabbit angrily. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Here! Come and\\nhelp me out of THIS!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Sounds of more broken glass.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Now tell me, Pat, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that in the window?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Sure, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an arm, yer honour!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (He pronounced it \\xe2\\x80\\x98arrum.\\xe2\\x80\\x99)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\\nwindow!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an arm for all that.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\nnow and then; such as, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sure, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it, yer honour, at all, at\\nall!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do as I tell you, you coward!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and at last she spread out her\\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\nTWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What a number of\\ncucumber-frames there must be!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I wonder what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do\\nnext! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\nsure I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to stay in here any longer!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\\nall talking together: she made out the words: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the other\\nladder?--Why, I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to bring but one; Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got the other--Bill!\\nfetch it here, lad!--Here, put \\xe2\\x80\\x98em up at this corner--No, tie \\xe2\\x80\\x98em\\ntogether first--they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reach half high enough yet--Oh! they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\ndo well enough; don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\\nrope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming\\ndown! Heads below!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (a loud crash)--\\xe2\\x80\\x98Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I\\nfancy--Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t! YOU do it!--That I\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, then!--Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re to\\ngo down the chimney!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh! So Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to come down the chimney, has he?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice to\\nherself. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be in\\nBill\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\\nI THINK I can kick a little!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\\ntill she heard a little animal (she couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guess of what sort it was)\\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\\nsaying to herself \\xe2\\x80\\x98This is Bill,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\\nsee what would happen next.\\n\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \\xe2\\x80\\x98There goes Bill!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nthen the Rabbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice along--\\xe2\\x80\\x98Catch him, you by the hedge!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 then\\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices--\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hold up his head--Brandy\\nnow--Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\\nus all about it!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bill,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought\\nAlice,) \\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m better now--but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m\\na deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me\\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98So you did, old fellow!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the others.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98We must burn the house down!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Rabbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice; and Alice called\\nout as loud as she could, \\xe2\\x80\\x98If you do. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll set Dinah at you!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\nwonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d take the\\nroof off.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98A barrowful will do, to begin with.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98A barrowful of WHAT?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll put a stop to this,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nshe said to herself, and shouted out, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better not do that again!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nwhich produced another dead silence.\\n\\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\\nhead. \\xe2\\x80\\x98If I eat one of these cakes,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sure to make\\nSOME change in my size; and as it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t possibly make me larger, it must\\nmake me smaller, I suppose.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\\nthe door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\\nanimals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\\nin the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\\nsafe in a thick wood.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98The first thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice to herself, as she wandered\\nabout in the wood, \\xe2\\x80\\x98is to grow to my right size again; and the second\\nthing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\\nthe best plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\ngreat hurry.\\n\\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Poor little thing!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nsaid Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\\nshe was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\\nhungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\\nall her coaxing.\\n\\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\n\\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\\ntill the puppy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And yet what a dear little puppy it was!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, as she leant\\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\\nleaves: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d nearly forgotten that\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\\nquestion is, what?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\nwas on the top of it.\\n\\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\\nthat was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\\nhookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar\\n\\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:\\nat last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed\\nher in a languid, sleepy voice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Who are YOU?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\\nrather shyly, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\\nwho I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\nchanged several times since then.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What do you mean by that?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar sternly. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Explain\\nyourself!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain MYSELF, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid, sir\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not\\nmyself, you see.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put it more clearly,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice replied very politely,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98for I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, perhaps you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t found it so yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but when you\\nhave to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll feel it a little\\nqueer, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not a bit,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98all I know\\nis, it would feel very queer to ME.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Who are YOU?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making such VERY\\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I think,\\nyou ought to tell me who YOU are, first.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\\nstate of mind, she turned away.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come back!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Caterpillar called after her. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve something important\\nto say!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Keep your temper,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Is that all?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\ncould.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and\\nperhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some\\nminutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\\narms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98So you think\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re changed, do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid I am, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember things as I\\nused--and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember WHAT things?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried to say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but it all came\\ndifferent!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Repeat, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:--\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98You are old, Father William,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the young man said,\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98And your hair has become very white;\\n   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98In my youth,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Father William replied to his son,\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98I feared it might injure the brain;\\n   But, now that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m perfectly sure I have none,\\n    Why, I do it again and again.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98You are old,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the youth, \\xe2\\x80\\x98as I mentioned before,\\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\\n   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98In my youth,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x98I kept all my limbs very supple\\n   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98You are old,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the youth, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and your jaws are too weak\\n    For anything tougher than suet;\\n   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--\\n    Pray how did you manage to do it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98In my youth,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said his father, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I took to the law,\\n    And argued each case with my wife;\\n   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98You are old,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the youth, \\xe2\\x80\\x98one would hardly suppose\\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\\n   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\\n    What made you so awfully clever?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n    Said his father; \\xe2\\x80\\x98don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give yourself airs!\\n   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\n    Be off, or I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll kick you down stairs!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That is not said right,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not QUITE right, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, timidly; \\xe2\\x80\\x98some of the words\\nhave got altered.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It is wrong from beginning to end,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar decidedly, and\\nthere was silence for some minutes.\\n\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What size do you want to be?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not particular as to size,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice hastily replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x98only one\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like changing so often, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I DON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T know,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Are you content now?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nsaid Alice: \\xe2\\x80\\x98three inches is such a wretched height to be.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It is a very good height indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing\\nitself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not used to it!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And\\nshe thought of herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I wish the creatures wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so easily\\noffended!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get used to it in time,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar; and it put the\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\n\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In\\na minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\\nand yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\ngrow shorter.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice to herself.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of the mushroom,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\n\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying\\nto make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly\\nround, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she\\nstretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit\\nof the edge with each hand.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And now which is which?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\\nblow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\n\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\nlefthand bit.\\n\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n  *    *    *    *    *    *    *\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, my head\\xe2\\x80\\x99s free at last!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What CAN all that green stuff be?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98And where HAVE my\\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\n\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she\\ntried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her\\nneck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had\\njust succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\\nto dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\\nof the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\\nher draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\\nwas beating her violently with its wings.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Serpent!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 screamed the Pigeon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m NOT a serpent!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice indignantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Let me alone!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Serpent, I say again!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,\\nand added with a kind of sob, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried every way, and nothing seems\\nto suit them!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the least idea what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried the roots of trees, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried banks, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried\\nhedges,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but those\\nserpents! There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no pleasing them!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98As if it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Pigeon;\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\\nhaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very sorry you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been annoyed,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, who was beginning to\\nsee its meaning.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And just as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d taken the highest tree in the wood,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 continued the\\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and just as I was thinking I\\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from\\nthe sky! Ugh, Serpent!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m NOT a serpent, I tell you!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a--I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well! WHAT are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Pigeon. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I can see you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to\\ninvent something!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I--I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little girl,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98A likely story indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\ncontempt. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE\\nwith such a neck as that! No, no! You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a serpent; and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use\\ndenying it. I suppose you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be telling me next that you never tasted an\\negg!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, who was a very truthful\\nchild; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\nknow.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Pigeon; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but if they do, why then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\na kind of serpent, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all I can say.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\nlooking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me\\nwhether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a little girl or a serpent?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It matters a good deal to ME,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice hastily; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not looking\\nfor eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want YOURS: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nlike them raw.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, be off, then!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\\nshe could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\\nevery now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\\nremembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\\nshe set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\\nother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\\nsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\n\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\nand began talking to herself, as usual. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s half my plan done\\nnow! How puzzling all these changes are! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m never sure what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going\\nto be, from one minute to another! However, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got back to my right\\nsize: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\\nto be done, I wonder?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\\nplace, with a little house in it about four feet high. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Whoever lives\\nthere,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,\\nI should frighten them out of their wits!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So she began nibbling at the\\nrighthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\\nhad brought herself down to nine inches high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\\n\\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\nwood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\\nfish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\\nby another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\\nover their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,\\nand crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\n\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x98For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen\\nto play croquet.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\\nonly changing the order of the words a little, \\xe2\\x80\\x98From the Queen. An\\ninvitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\n\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\\nwood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\n\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no sort of use in knocking,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Footman, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and that for\\ntwo reasons. First, because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the same side of the door as you\\nare; secondly, because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making such a noise inside, no one could\\npossibly hear you.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\\ngoing on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\\na great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Please, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98how am I to get in?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98There might be some sense in your knocking,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Footman went on\\nwithout attending to her, \\xe2\\x80\\x98if we had the door between us. For instance,\\nif you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nHe was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\\nAlice thought decidedly uncivil. \\xe2\\x80\\x98But perhaps he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she\\nsaid to herself; \\xe2\\x80\\x98his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\\nBut at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she\\nrepeated, aloud.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I shall sit here,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Footman remarked, \\xe2\\x80\\x98till tomorrow--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\nskimming out, straight at the Footman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head: it just grazed his nose,\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--or next day, maybe,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\nas if nothing had happened.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How am I to get in?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98ARE you to get in at all?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Footman. \\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first\\nquestion, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really\\ndreadful,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she muttered to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98the way all the creatures argue.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough to drive one crazy!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\nremark, with variations. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I shall sit here,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98on and off, for\\ndays and days.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But what am I to do?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Anything you like,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Footman, and began whistling.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use in talking to him,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice desperately: \\xe2\\x80\\x98he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nperfectly idiotic!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And she opened the door and went in.\\n\\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\\nthe middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\\na large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice said to herself,\\nas well as she could for sneezing.\\n\\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\\nsneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\nalternately without a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pause. The only things in the kitchen\\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on\\nthe hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Please would you tell me,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \\xe2\\x80\\x98why\\nyour cat grins like that?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Cheshire cat,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why. Pig!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\\nand not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know\\nthat cats COULD grin.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98They all can,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and most of \\xe2\\x80\\x98em do.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know of any that do,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\npleased to have got into a conversation.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know much,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fact.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\nthe Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, PLEASE mind what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried Alice, jumping up and down in\\nan agony of terror. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose\\xe2\\x80\\x99; as an unusually\\nlarge saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98If everybody minded their own business,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Duchess said in a hoarse\\ngrowl, \\xe2\\x80\\x98the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Which would NOT be an advantage,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, who felt very glad to get\\nan opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Just think of\\nwhat work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes\\ntwenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Talking of axes,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess, \\xe2\\x80\\x98chop off her head!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\nbe listening, so she went on again: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is\\nit twelve? I--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother ME,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I never could abide figures!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nAnd with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of\\nlullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of\\nevery line:\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98Speak roughly to your little boy,\\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\\n   He only does it to annoy,\\n    Because he knows it teases.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n         CHORUS.\\n\\n (In which the cook and the baby joined):--\\n\\n       \\xe2\\x80\\x98Wow! wow! wow!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:--\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98I speak severely to my boy,\\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\\n   For he can thoroughly enjoy\\n    The pepper when he pleases!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n         CHORUS.\\n\\n       \\xe2\\x80\\x98Wow! wow! wow!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Duchess said to Alice,\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I must go and get ready to play\\ncroquet with the Queen,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw\\na frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\n\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \\xe2\\x80\\x98just\\nlike a star-fish,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting\\nlike a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and\\nstraightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute\\nor two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\n\\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried\\nit out into the open air. \\xe2\\x80\\x98IF I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take this child away with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nthought Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be\\nmurder to leave it behind?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She said the last words out loud, and the\\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grunt,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not at all a proper way of expressing\\nyourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to\\nsee what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\\na VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its\\neyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not\\nlike the look of the thing at all. \\xe2\\x80\\x98But perhaps it was only sobbing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nshe thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any\\ntears.\\n\\nNo, there were no tears. \\xe2\\x80\\x98If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nsaid Alice, seriously, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\\nnow!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\\n\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Now, what am I to do with\\nthis creature when I get it home?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when it grunted again, so violently,\\nthat she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could\\nbe NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she\\nfelt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\\n\\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see\\nit trot away quietly into the wood. \\xe2\\x80\\x98If it had grown up,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said\\nto herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And she began thinking over other\\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\nto herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98if one only knew the right way to change them--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when she\\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a\\ntree a few yards off.\\n\\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\\nthought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Cheshire Puss,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pleased so far,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, and she went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Would you\\ntell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much care where--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter which way you go,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice added as an explanation.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sure to do that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat, \\xe2\\x80\\x98if you only walk long\\nenough.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What sort of people live about here?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98In THAT direction,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \\xe2\\x80\\x98lives\\na Hatter: and in THAT direction,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 waving the other paw, \\xe2\\x80\\x98lives a March\\nHare. Visit either you like: they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re both mad.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go among mad people,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice remarked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat: \\xe2\\x80\\x98we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all mad here. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mad.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re mad.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How do you know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mad?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You must be,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat, \\xe2\\x80\\x98or you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have come here.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \\xe2\\x80\\x98And how\\ndo you know that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re mad?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98To begin with,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat, \\xe2\\x80\\x98a dog\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not mad. You grant that?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I suppose so,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Cat went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98you see, a dog growls when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s angry,\\nand wags its tail when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pleased. Now I growl when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pleased, and\\nwag my tail when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m angry. Therefore I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mad.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I call it purring, not growling,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Call it what you like,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do you play croquet with the\\nQueen to-day?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I should like it very much,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98but I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been invited\\nyet.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see me there,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat, and vanished.\\n\\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\nit suddenly appeared again.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d nearly\\nforgotten to ask.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It turned into a pig,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\\nin a natural way.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I thought it would,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat, and vanished again.\\n\\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen hatters before,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she\\nsaid to herself; \\xe2\\x80\\x98the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\nperhaps as this is May it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be raving mad--at least not so mad as\\nit was in March.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Did you say pig, or fig?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I said pig,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 replied Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and I wish you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep appearing and\\nvanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98All right,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well! I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve often seen a cat without a grin,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but a grin\\nwithout a cat! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house\\nof the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to\\nabout two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\\nsaying to herself \\xe2\\x80\\x98Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost\\nwish I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d gone to see the Hatter instead!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party\\n\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Very\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98only, as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asleep, I\\nsuppose it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\none corner of it: \\xe2\\x80\\x98No room! No room!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 they cried out when they saw Alice\\ncoming. \\xe2\\x80\\x98There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PLENTY of room!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice indignantly, and she sat\\ndown in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Have some wine,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\n\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any wine,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she remarked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98There isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the March Hare.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very civil of you to offer it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice angrily.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said\\nthe March Hare.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know it was YOUR table,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laid for a great\\nmany more than three.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Your hair wants cutting,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice\\nfor some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You should learn not to make personal remarks,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice said with some\\nseverity; \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very rude.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID\\nwas, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, we shall have some fun now!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nbegun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she added aloud.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the\\nMarch Hare.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Exactly so,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then you should say what you mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the March Hare went on.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I do,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice hastily replied; \\xe2\\x80\\x98at least--at least I mean what I\\nsay--that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same thing, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not the same thing a bit!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You might just as well say\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see what I eat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the same thing as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI eat what I see\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You might just as well say,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 added the March Hare, \\xe2\\x80\\x98that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI like what I\\nget\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the same thing as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI get what I like\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You might just as well say,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\ntalking in his sleep, \\xe2\\x80\\x98that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI breathe when I sleep\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the same thing\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI sleep when I breathe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It IS the same thing with you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter, and here the\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice\\nthought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\\nwhich wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much.\\n\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What day of the month\\nis it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\nand holding it to his ear.\\n\\nAlice considered a little, and then said \\xe2\\x80\\x98The fourth.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Two days wrong!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sighed the Hatter. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I told you butter wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suit\\nthe works!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It was the BEST butter,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the March Hare meekly replied.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter grumbled:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98you shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have put it in with the bread-knife.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \\xe2\\x80\\x98It was the BEST butter,\\nyou know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What a\\nfunny watch!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she remarked. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It tells the day of the month, and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ntell what o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock it is!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why should it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 muttered the Hatter. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Does YOUR watch tell you what\\nyear it is?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course not,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice replied very readily: \\xe2\\x80\\x98but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because it\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Which is just the case with MINE,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter.\\n\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remark seemed to have no\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite\\nunderstand you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said, as politely as she could.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98The Dormouse is asleep again,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\n\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\neyes, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Have you guessed the riddle yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\nagain.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No, I give it up,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice replied: \\xe2\\x80\\x98what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the answer?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the slightest idea,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Nor I,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice sighed wearily. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I think you might do something better with the\\ntime,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98If you knew Time as well as I do,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter, \\xe2\\x80\\x98you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk\\nabout wasting IT. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s HIM.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what you mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Perhaps not,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice cautiously replied: \\xe2\\x80\\x98but I know I have to beat time\\nwhen I learn music.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Ah! that accounts for it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter. \\xe2\\x80\\x98He won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand beating.\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do almost anything\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d only have to whisper a\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\ntime for dinner!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n[\\xe2\\x80\\x98I only wish it was,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That would be grand, certainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice thoughtfully: \\xe2\\x80\\x98but then--I\\nshouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be hungry for it, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not at first, perhaps,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter: \\xe2\\x80\\x98but you could keep it to\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Is that the way YOU manage?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice asked.\\n\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Not I!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x98We\\nquarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (pointing\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \\xe2\\x80\\x98--it was at the great concert\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\n\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\n     How I wonder what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nYou know the song, perhaps?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard something like it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It goes on, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x98in this way:--\\n\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUp above the world you fly,\\n     Like a tea-tray in the sky.\\n         Twinkle, twinkle--\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \\xe2\\x80\\x98Twinkle,\\ntwinkle, twinkle, twinkle--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and went on so long that they had to pinch\\nit to make it stop.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hardly finished the first verse,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter, \\xe2\\x80\\x98when the\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s murdering the time! Off with his\\nhead!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How dreadfully savage!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And ever since that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x98he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ndo a thing I ask! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always six o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock now.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nA bright idea came into Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Is that the reason so many\\ntea-things are put out here?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter with a sigh: \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always tea-time,\\nand we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Exactly so,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter: \\xe2\\x80\\x98as the things get used up.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice ventured\\nto ask.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Suppose we change the subject,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m afraid I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know one,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\nproposal.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then the Dormouse shall!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 they both cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Wake up, Dormouse!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\n\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t asleep,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said in a\\nhoarse, feeble voice: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I heard every word you fellows were saying.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Tell us a story!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the March Hare.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, please do!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pleaded Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And be quick about it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 added the Hatter, \\xe2\\x80\\x98or you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be asleep again\\nbefore it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Dormouse began\\nin a great hurry; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What did they live on?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, who always took a great interest in\\nquestions of eating and drinking.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98They lived on treacle,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\ntwo.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have done that, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice gently remarked; \\xe2\\x80\\x98they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d\\nhave been ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98So they were,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dormouse; \\xe2\\x80\\x98VERY ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \\xe2\\x80\\x98But\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Take some more tea,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had nothing yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice replied in an offended tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x98so I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ntake more.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You mean you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take LESS,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter: \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very easy to take\\nMORE than nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making personal remarks now?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\n\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\\nto some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\nrepeated her question. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\nsaid, \\xe2\\x80\\x98It was a treacle-well.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no such thing!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\nHatter and the March Hare went \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sh! sh!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the Dormouse sulkily\\nremarked, \\xe2\\x80\\x98If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be civil, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better finish the story for\\nyourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No, please go on!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice said very humbly; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interrupt again. I\\ndare say there may be ONE.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98One, indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\ngo on. \\xe2\\x80\\x98And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\\nyou know--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What did they draw?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Treacle,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I want a clean cup,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interrupted the Hatter: \\xe2\\x80\\x98let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all move one place\\non.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\nmoved into the Dormouse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took\\nthe place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\n\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\ncautiously: \\xe2\\x80\\x98But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\nfrom?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You can draw water out of a water-well,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter; \\xe2\\x80\\x98so I should\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But they were IN the well,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to\\nnotice this last remark.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course they were\\xe2\\x80\\x99, said the Dormouse; \\xe2\\x80\\x98--well in.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98They were learning to draw,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and they drew all manner of\\nthings--everything that begins with an M--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why with an M?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why not?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the March Hare.\\n\\nAlice was silent.\\n\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into\\na doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with\\na little shriek, and went on: \\xe2\\x80\\x98--that begins with an M, such as\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\\nthings are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmuch of a muchness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--did you ever see such a thing as a\\ndrawing of a muchness?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Really, now you ask me,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, very much confused, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nthink--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then you shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter.\\n\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\nthe teapot.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98At any rate I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never go THERE again!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice as she picked her\\nway through the wood. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all\\nmy life!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\nleading right into it. \\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very curious!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x98But\\neverything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And in\\nshe went.\\n\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\\nglass table. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll manage better this time,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to herself,\\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\\nhad kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:\\nthen she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at\\nlast in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool\\nfountains.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. The Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Croquet-Ground\\n\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went\\nnearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of\\nthem say, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Look out now, Five! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go splashing paint over me like\\nthat!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Five, in a sulky tone; \\xe2\\x80\\x98Seven jogged my\\nelbow.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right, Five! Always lay the\\nblame on others!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98YOU\\xe2\\x80\\x99D better not talk!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Five. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I heard the Queen say only\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What for?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the one who had spoken first.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s none of YOUR business, Two!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Seven.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, it IS his business!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Five, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell him--it was for\\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, of all the unjust\\nthings--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and\\nall of them bowed low.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Would you tell me,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, a little timidly, \\xe2\\x80\\x98why you are painting\\nthose roses?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\nvoice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\nRED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.\\nSo you see, Miss, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 At this\\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\nout \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Queen! The Queen!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the three gardeners instantly threw\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\n\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like\\nthe three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\\nwith hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among\\nthem Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried\\nnervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\\nnoticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncrown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\\nprocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\n\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\nof such a rule at processions; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and besides, what would be the use of\\na procession,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought she, \\xe2\\x80\\x98if people had all to lie down upon their\\nfaces, so that they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So she stood still where she was,\\nand waited.\\n\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\nat her, and the Queen said severely \\xe2\\x80\\x98Who is this?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She said it to the\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Idiot!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\\nAlice, she went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your name, child?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice very politely;\\nbut she added, to herself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only a pack of cards, after\\nall. I needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be afraid of them!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And who are THESE?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who\\nwere lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their\\nfaces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\\npack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or\\ncourtiers, or three of her own children.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How should I know?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no\\nbusiness of MINE.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed \\xe2\\x80\\x98Off with her head! Off--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Nonsense!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\nsilent.\\n\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \\xe2\\x80\\x98Consider, my\\ndear: she is only a child!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \\xe2\\x80\\x98Turn them\\nover!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Get up!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Leave off that!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 screamed the Queen. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You make me giddy.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And then,\\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98What HAVE you been doing here?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98May it please your Majesty,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\ndown on one knee as he spoke, \\xe2\\x80\\x98we were trying--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I see!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Off with their heads!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the procession moved on, three of the\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\nto Alice for protection.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be beheaded!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, and she put them into a large\\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\nothers.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Are their heads off?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shouted the Queen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the soldiers shouted\\nin reply.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shouted the Queen. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Can you play croquet?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\nevidently meant for her.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shouted Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come on, then!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\nwondering very much what would happen next.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s--it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very fine day!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said a timid voice at her side. She was\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Very,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice: \\xe2\\x80\\x98--where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Duchess?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hush! Hush!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \\xe2\\x80\\x98She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s under\\nsentence of execution.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What for?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Did you say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a pity!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Rabbit asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at all a pity. I said\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98She boxed the Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ears--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\nscream of laughter. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, hush!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\ntone. \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\nQueen said--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Get to your places!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\\nher life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\\nthe mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\\nup and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\n\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\\nher arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\\nits neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\\nblow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\\nwith such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\\nlaughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\\nagain, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\\nitself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\\ngenerally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\\nhedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\\nand walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\\nconclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\n\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\\ntime the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\nshouting \\xe2\\x80\\x98Off with his head!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98Off with her head!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 about once in a\\nminute.\\n\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98and then,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought she, \\xe2\\x80\\x98what would become of me? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dreadfully\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s any one\\nleft alive!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\\nin the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\\na minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How are you getting on?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\nenough for it to speak with.\\n\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use\\nspeaking to it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x98till its ears have come, or at least one\\nof them.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was\\nenough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they play at all fairly,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice began, in rather a\\ncomplaining tone, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear\\noneself speak--and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to have any rules in particular;\\nat least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve no idea how\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the\\narch I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\nground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hedgehog just now, only\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How do you like the Queen?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Cat in a low voice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice: \\xe2\\x80\\x98she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so extremely--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Just then she noticed\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--likely to win, that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hardly worth while finishing the game.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Who ARE you talking to?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\\nat the Cat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head with great curiosity.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice: \\xe2\\x80\\x98allow me to\\nintroduce it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the look of it at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King: \\xe2\\x80\\x98however, it may\\nkiss my hand if it likes.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather not,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Cat remarked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be impertinent,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look at me like that!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nHe got behind Alice as he spoke.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98A cat may look at a king,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve read that in some book,\\nbut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember where.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, it must be removed,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King very decidedly, and he called\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, \\xe2\\x80\\x98My dear! I wish you would\\nhave this cat removed!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Off with his head!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said, without even looking round.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fetch the executioner myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King eagerly, and he\\nhurried off.\\n\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\non, as she heard the Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice in the distance, screaming with\\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\n\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\\nother side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless\\nsort of way to fly up into a tree.\\n\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \\xe2\\x80\\x98but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nmatter much,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98as all the arches are gone from this side\\nof the ground.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\nfriend.\\n\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a\\nlarge crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\n\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\nwhat they said.\\n\\nThe executioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument was, that you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cut off a head unless\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\nthing before, and he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to begin at HIS time of life.\\n\\nThe King\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\nbeheaded, and that you weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to talk nonsense.\\n\\nThe Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument was, that if something wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done about it in less\\nthan no time she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last\\nremark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\\n\\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but \\xe2\\x80\\x98It belongs to the Duchess:\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better ask HER about it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in prison,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Queen said to the executioner: \\xe2\\x80\\x98fetch her here.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\n\\n The Cat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\\nby the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely\\ndisappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down\\nlooking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Story\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and\\nthey walked off together.\\n\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98When I\\xe2\\x80\\x99M a Duchess,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone\\nthough), \\xe2\\x80\\x98I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very\\nwell without--Maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nshe went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of\\nrule, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes\\nthem bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children\\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so\\nstingy about it, you know--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thinking\\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\na bit.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Perhaps it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice ventured to remark.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Tut, tut, child!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a moral, if only\\nyou can find it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side as\\nshe spoke.\\n\\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\\nDuchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoulder, and it was an\\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\nbore it as well as she could.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98The game\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on rather better now,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said, by way of keeping up\\nthe conversation a little.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x99Tis so,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess: \\xe2\\x80\\x98and the moral of that is--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, \\xe2\\x80\\x98tis love,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98tis love, that makes the world go round!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Somebody said,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice whispered, \\xe2\\x80\\x98that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done by everybody minding\\ntheir own business!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess, digging her\\nsharp little chin into Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shoulder as she added, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and the moral\\nof THAT is--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\nthemselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How fond she is of finding morals in things!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice thought to herself.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I dare say you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wondering why I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put my arm round your waist,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nthe Duchess said after a pause: \\xe2\\x80\\x98the reason is, that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doubtful about\\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98HE might bite,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\\nhave the experiment tried.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Very true,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess: \\xe2\\x80\\x98flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\\nthe moral of that is--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBirds of a feather flock together.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Only mustard isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bird,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice remarked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Right, as usual,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess: \\xe2\\x80\\x98what a clear way you have of\\nputting things!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mineral, I THINK,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\neverything that Alice said; \\xe2\\x80\\x98there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a large mustard-mine near here. And\\nthe moral of that is--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe more there is of mine, the less there is of\\nyours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, I know!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a vegetable. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look like one, but it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I quite agree with you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and the moral of that\\nis--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe what you would seem to be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d--or if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like it put more\\nsimply--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\\nthan what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I think I should understand that better,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice said very politely, \\xe2\\x80\\x98if\\nI had it written down: but I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite follow it as you say it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Duchess replied, in\\na pleased tone.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Pray don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said\\nAlice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about trouble!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I make you a present\\nof everything I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said as yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98A cheap sort of present!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give\\nbirthday presents like that!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But she did not venture to say it out\\nloud.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Thinking again?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\nlittle chin.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve a right to think,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\nfeel a little worried.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Just about as much right,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Duchess, \\xe2\\x80\\x98as pigs have to fly; and\\nthe m--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nBut here, to Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great surprise, the Duchess\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice died away, even\\nin the middle of her favourite word \\xe2\\x80\\x98moral,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the arm that was linked\\ninto hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen\\nin front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98A fine day, your Majesty!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Now, I give you fair warning,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\nground as she spoke; \\xe2\\x80\\x98either you or your head must be off, and that in\\nabout half no time! Take your choice!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go on with the game,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\\ntoo much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\ncroquet-ground.\\n\\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absence, and were\\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s delay would\\ncost them their lives.\\n\\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\\nthe other players, and shouting \\xe2\\x80\\x98Off with his head!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98Off with her\\nhead!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\\nwho of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\\nthe end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\\nplayers, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\\nunder sentence of execution.\\n\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Have\\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I never saw one, or heard of one,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come on, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and he shall tell you his history,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\nto the company generally, \\xe2\\x80\\x98You are all pardoned.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, THAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S a good\\nthing!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\\n\\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\\n(IF you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \\xe2\\x80\\x98Up, lazy\\nthing!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and take this young lady to see the Mock\\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\\nexecutions I have ordered\\xe2\\x80\\x99; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\\nthe Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\\nthe whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\\nafter that savage Queen: so she waited.\\n\\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What fun!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon,\\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What IS the fun?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why, SHE,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon. \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all her fancy, that: they never\\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Everybody says \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccome on!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, as she went slowly\\nafter it: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\\npitied him deeply. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What is his sorrow?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she asked the Gryphon, and the\\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all his\\nfancy, that: he hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98This here young lady,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon, \\xe2\\x80\\x98she wants for to know your\\nhistory, she do.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell it her,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \\xe2\\x80\\x98sit\\ndown, both of you, and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak a word till I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve finished.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\\nherself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t begin.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But\\nshe waited patiently.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Once,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I was a real\\nTurtle.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\noccasional exclamation of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hjckrrh!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 from the Gryphon, and the constant\\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\\nsaying, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but she could\\nnot help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\\nnothing.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98When we were little,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, \\xe2\\x80\\x98we went to school in the\\nsea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle\\nangrily: \\xe2\\x80\\x98really you are very dull!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nadded the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\\nAlice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\\nto the Mock Turtle, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Drive on, old fellow! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be all day about it!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nand he went on in these words:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I never said I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interrupted Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You did,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hold your tongue!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99VE been to a day-school, too,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98you needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so proud\\nas all that.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98With extras?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98we learned French and music.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And washing?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Certainly not!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice indignantly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Ah! then yours wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a really good school,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle in\\na tone of great relief. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrench, music, AND WASHING--extra.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have wanted it much,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98living at the bottom of\\nthe sea.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to learn it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\nonly took the regular course.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What was that?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 inquired Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle\\nreplied; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,\\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I never heard of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUglification,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice ventured to say. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What! Never heard of\\nuglifying!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it exclaimed. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice doubtfully: \\xe2\\x80\\x98it means--to--make--anything--prettier.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, then,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to uglify is,\\nyou ARE a simpleton.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\\nturned to the Mock Turtle, and said \\xe2\\x80\\x98What else had you to learn?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, there was Mystery,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle replied, counting off\\nthe subjects on his flappers, \\xe2\\x80\\x98--Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\nSeaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\nthat used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\nFainting in Coils.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What was THAT like?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show it you myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m too\\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t time,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I went to the Classics master, though.\\nHe was an old crab, HE was.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I never went to him,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \\xe2\\x80\\x98he taught\\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98So he did, so he did,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And how many hours a day did you do lessons?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, in a hurry to\\nchange the subject.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Ten hours the first day,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle: \\xe2\\x80\\x98nine the next, and so\\non.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What a curious plan!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exclaimed Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the reason they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re called lessons,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon remarked:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98because they lessen from day to day.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\nbefore she made her next remark. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Then the eleventh day must have been a\\nholiday?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course it was,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And how did you manage on the twelfth?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice went on eagerly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough about lessons,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided\\ntone: \\xe2\\x80\\x98tell her something about the games now.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\ntwo sobs choked his voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:--\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You may not have lived much under the sea--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 [\\xe2\\x80\\x98I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said\\nAlice)--\\xe2\\x80\\x98and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n(Alice began to say \\xe2\\x80\\x98I once tasted--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but checked herself hastily, and\\nsaid \\xe2\\x80\\x98No, never\\xe2\\x80\\x99) \\xe2\\x80\\x98--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\nLobster Quadrille is!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What sort of a dance is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon, \\xe2\\x80\\x98you first form into a line along the\\nsea-shore--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Two lines!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the Mock Turtle. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\nthen, when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98THAT generally takes some time,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interrupted the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--you advance twice--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Each with a lobster as a partner!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98advance twice, set to partners--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--change lobsters, and retire in same order,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 continued the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98you throw the--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98The lobsters!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--as far out to sea as you can--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Swim after them!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 screamed the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Turn a somersault in the sea!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\nabout.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Change lobsters again!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Back to land again, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all the first figure,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock\\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been\\njumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly\\nand quietly, and looked at Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It must be a very pretty dance,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice timidly.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Would you like to see a little of it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Very much indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s try the first figure!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, YOU sing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve forgotten the words.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\nand sadly:--\\n\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill you walk a little faster?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a whiting to a snail.\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a porpoise close behind us, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treading on my tail.\\n\\n See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\n They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?\\n\\n Will you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, will you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, will you join the dance?\\n Will you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, will you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you join the dance?\\n\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\n When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n  But the snail replied \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo far, too far!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and gave a look askance--\\n Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\n\\n Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\n Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\n\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat matters it how far we go?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his scaly friend replied.\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\n The further off from England the nearer is to France--\\n Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\n\\n Will you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, will you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, will you join the dance?\\n Will you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, will you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you join the dance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Thank you, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very interesting dance to watch,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, feeling\\nvery glad that it was over at last: \\xe2\\x80\\x98and I do so like that curious song\\nabout the whiting!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, as to the whiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle, \\xe2\\x80\\x98they--you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen them,\\nof course?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve often seen them at dinn--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she checked herself\\nhastily.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where Dinn may be,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle, \\xe2\\x80\\x98but if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nseen them so often, of course you know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I believe so,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice replied thoughtfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x98They have their tails in\\ntheir mouths--and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all over crumbs.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wrong about the crumbs,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle: \\xe2\\x80\\x98crumbs would all\\nwash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the\\nreason is--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--\\xe2\\x80\\x98Tell her\\nabout the reason and all that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said to the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98The reason is,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon, \\xe2\\x80\\x98that they WOULD go with the lobsters\\nto the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long\\nway. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get\\nthem out again. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Thank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very interesting. I never knew so much\\nabout a whiting before.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I can tell you more than that, if you like,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do you\\nknow why it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called a whiting?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I never thought about it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\n\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Does the boots and shoes!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she repeated\\nin a wondering tone.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I mean, what\\nmakes them so shiny?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\nanswer. \\xe2\\x80\\x98They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re done with blacking, I believe.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Boots and shoes under the sea,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98are done with a whiting. Now you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And what are they made of?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Soles and eels, of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98any shrimp could have told you that.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been the whiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\\non the song, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have said to the porpoise, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeep back, please: we\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want YOU with us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98They were obliged to have him with them,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98no\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it really?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course not,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle: \\xe2\\x80\\x98why, if a fish came to ME, and\\ntold me he was going a journey, I should say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith what porpoise?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you mean \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurpose\\xe2\\x80\\x9d?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I mean what I say,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\nthe Gryphon added \\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hear some of YOUR adventures.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said\\nAlice a little timidly: \\xe2\\x80\\x98but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use going back to yesterday,\\nbecause I was a different person then.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Explain all that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No, no! The adventures first,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98explanations take such a dreadful time.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\ntheir eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went\\non. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about\\nher repeating \\xe2\\x80\\x98YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to the Caterpillar, and the\\nwords all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,\\nand said \\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very curious.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about as curious as it can be,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It all came different!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\nbegin.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\nauthority over Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Stand up and repeat \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the\\nGryphon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nthought Alice; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I might as well be at school at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 However, she\\ngot up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\nvery queer indeed:--\\n\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x99Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n   As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\n  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n       [later editions continued as follows\\n  When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\n  And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\n  But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\n  His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the\\nGryphon.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I never heard it before,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle; \\xe2\\x80\\x98but it sounds\\nuncommon nonsense.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\nwondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I should like to have it explained,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Mock Turtle.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98She can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon hastily. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Go on with the next\\nverse.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But about his toes?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle persisted. \\xe2\\x80\\x98How COULD he turn them\\nout with his nose, you know?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first position in dancing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice said; but was dreadfully\\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Go on with the next verse,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \\xe2\\x80\\x98it\\nbegins \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI passed by his garden.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--\\n\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x98I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\n  How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n    [later editions continued as follows\\n  The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\\n  While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\n  When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\n  Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\\n  While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\n  And concluded the banquet--]\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Mock Turtle\\ninterrupted, \\xe2\\x80\\x98if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t explain it as you go on? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s by far the most\\nconfusing thing I ever heard!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, I think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better leave off,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Gryphon: and Alice was\\nonly too glad to do so.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon went\\non. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice\\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTurtle Soup,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will you, old\\nfellow?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\nwith sobs, to sing this:--\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\n   Waiting in a hot tureen!\\n   Who for such dainties would not stoop?\\n   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n   Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\n   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\\n     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\n   Game, or any other dish?\\n   Who would not give all else for two\\n   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\n   Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\n     Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!\\n   Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\\n     Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Chorus again!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\nto repeat it, when a cry of \\xe2\\x80\\x98The trial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beginning!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was heard in the\\ndistance.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come on!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What trial is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\\nanswered \\xe2\\x80\\x98Come on!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,\\n     Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?\\n\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\\nand a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\\nwas a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\\nthat it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--\\xe2\\x80\\x98I wish they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get the\\ntrial done,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and hand round the refreshments!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But there\\nseemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\\nher, to pass away the time.\\n\\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\nthe name of nearly everything there. \\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the judge,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to\\nherself, \\xe2\\x80\\x98because of his great wig.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\\nnot look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the jury-box,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and those twelve creatures,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n(she was obliged to say \\xe2\\x80\\x98creatures,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 you see, because some of them were\\nanimals, and some were birds,) \\xe2\\x80\\x98I suppose they are the jurors.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 She said\\nthis last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\\nit: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\\nage knew the meaning of it at all. However, \\xe2\\x80\\x98jury-men\\xe2\\x80\\x99 would have done\\njust as well.\\n\\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \\xe2\\x80\\x98What are they\\ndoing?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \\xe2\\x80\\x98They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have anything to put\\ndown yet, before the trial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s begun.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re putting down their names,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Gryphon whispered in reply, \\xe2\\x80\\x98for\\nfear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Stupid things!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\\nhastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Silence in the court!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the\\nKing put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\\nwas talking.\\n\\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\\nthat all the jurors were writing down \\xe2\\x80\\x98stupid things!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on their slates,\\nand she could even make out that one of them didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to spell\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98stupid,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \\xe2\\x80\\x98A nice\\nmuddle their slates\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be in before the trial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice.\\n\\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\\ncould not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\\nobliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\\nof very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Herald, read the accusation!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King.\\n\\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\n      All on a summer day:\\n    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\\n      And took them quite away!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Consider your verdict,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King said to the jury.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Not yet, not yet!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \\xe2\\x80\\x98There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great\\ndeal to come before that!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Call the first witness,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\\nblasts on the trumpet, and called out, \\xe2\\x80\\x98First witness!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\\nhand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I beg pardon, your\\nMajesty,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he began, \\xe2\\x80\\x98for bringing these in: but I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t quite finished\\nmy tea when I was sent for.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You ought to have finished,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King. \\xe2\\x80\\x98When did you begin?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Fourteenth of March, I think it\\nwas,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Fifteenth,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the March Hare.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Sixteenth,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 added the Dormouse.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Write that down,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Take off your hat,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King said to the Hatter.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mine,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Stolen!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\\nmemorandum of the fact.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I keep them to sell,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter added as an explanation; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve none of\\nmy own. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a hatter.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Give your evidence,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King; \\xe2\\x80\\x98and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be nervous, or I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have\\nyou executed on the spot.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\\nhis confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\nbread-and-butter.\\n\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\\nlong as there was room for her.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I wish you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t squeeze so.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\nnext to her. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I can hardly breathe.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice very meekly: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m growing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve no right to grow here,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dormouse.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk nonsense,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice more boldly: \\xe2\\x80\\x98you know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re growing\\ntoo.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Dormouse: \\xe2\\x80\\x98not in that\\nridiculous fashion.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\\nother side of the court.\\n\\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\nof the court, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on\\nwhich the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Give your evidence,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King repeated angrily, \\xe2\\x80\\x98or I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have you\\nexecuted, whether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re nervous or not.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a poor man, your Majesty,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--and I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\\nbread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98The twinkling of the what?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It began with the tea,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter replied.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Of course twinkling begins with a T!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King sharply. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Do you\\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a poor man,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter went on, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and most things twinkled after\\nthat--only the March Hare said--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You did!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I deny it!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the March Hare.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98He denies it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King: \\xe2\\x80\\x98leave out that part.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Hatter went on, looking\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98After that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 continued the Hatter, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I cut some more bread-and-butter--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But what did the Dormouse say?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 one of the jury asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You MUST remember,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 remarked the King, \\xe2\\x80\\x98or I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have you executed.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\ndown on one knee. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a poor man, your Majesty,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he began.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a very poor speaker,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King.\\n\\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen that done,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve so often read\\nin the newspapers, at the end of trials, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was some attempts\\nat applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\ncourt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and I never understood what it meant till now.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98If that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all you know about it, you may stand down,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 continued the\\nKing.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go no lower,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter: \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the floor, as it is.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then you may SIT down,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King replied.\\n\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Now we shall get\\non better.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather finish my tea,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the\\nQueen, who was reading the list of singers.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You may go,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98--and just take his head off outside,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Queen added to one of the\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\nto the door.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Call the next witness!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King.\\n\\nThe next witness was the Duchess\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Give your evidence,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the cook.\\n\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, if I must, I must,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98What are tarts made of?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Pepper, mostly,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the cook.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Treacle,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said a sleepy voice behind her.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Collar that Dormouse,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Queen shrieked out. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Behead that Dormouse!\\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\\nwhiskers!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\ndisappeared.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Never mind!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, with an air of great relief. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Call the next\\nwitness.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Really, my dear,\\nYOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead\\nache!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very\\ncurious to see what the next witness would be like, \\xe2\\x80\\x98--for they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\ngot much evidence YET,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when\\nthe White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the\\nname \\xe2\\x80\\x98Alice!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Evidence\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Here!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\\nshe had accidentally upset the week before.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, I BEG your pardon!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of\\nthe goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea\\nthat they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or\\nthey would die.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98The trial cannot proceed,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King in a very grave voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x98until\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he repeated with\\ngreat emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\\n\\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got\\nit out again, and put it right; \\xe2\\x80\\x98not that it signifies much,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she said\\nto herself; \\xe2\\x80\\x98I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial\\none way up as the other.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\ncourt.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What do you know about this business?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King said to Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Nothing,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Nothing WHATEVER?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 persisted the King.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Nothing whatever,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very important,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit\\ninterrupted: \\xe2\\x80\\x98UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said in a\\nvery respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98UNimportant, of course, I meant,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King hastily said, and went on\\nto himself in an undertone,\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98important--unimportant--unimportant--important--\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as if he were trying\\nwhich word sounded best.\\n\\nSome of the jury wrote it down \\xe2\\x80\\x98important,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and some \\xe2\\x80\\x98unimportant.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter a bit,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she thought to herself.\\n\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\nhis note-book, cackled out \\xe2\\x80\\x98Silence!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and read out from his book, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Rule\\nForty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99M not a mile high,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98You are,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Nearly two miles high,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 added the Queen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Well, I shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go, at any rate,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice: \\xe2\\x80\\x98besides, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the oldest rule in the book,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then it ought to be Number One,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Consider your\\nverdict,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the White\\nRabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \\xe2\\x80\\x98this paper has just been picked\\nup.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in it?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t opened it yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the White Rabbit, \\xe2\\x80\\x98but it seems to be a\\nletter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It must have been that,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, \\xe2\\x80\\x98unless it was written to\\nnobody, which isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t usual, you know.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Who is it directed to?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said one of the jurymen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t directed at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the White Rabbit; \\xe2\\x80\\x98in fact, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nnothing written on the OUTSIDE.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and\\nadded \\xe2\\x80\\x98It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a letter, after all: it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a set of verses.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Are they in the prisoner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handwriting?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 asked another of the jurymen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the White Rabbit, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the queerest thing\\nabout it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (The jury all looked puzzled.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98He must have imitated somebody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King. (The jury\\nall brightened up again.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Please your Majesty,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Knave, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t write it, and they\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t prove I did: there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no name signed at the end.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98If you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sign it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, \\xe2\\x80\\x98that only makes the matter\\nworse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have signed your\\nname like an honest man.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\nclever thing the King had said that day.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That PROVES his guilt,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It proves nothing of the sort!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know\\nwhat they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re about!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Read them,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King.\\n\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Where shall I begin, please\\nyour Majesty?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he asked.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Begin at the beginning,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King said gravely, \\xe2\\x80\\x98and go on till you\\ncome to the end: then stop.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:--\\n\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x98They told me you had been to her,\\n    And mentioned me to him:\\n   She gave me a good character,\\n    But said I could not swim.\\n\\n   He sent them word I had not gone\\n    (We know it to be true):\\n   If she should push the matter on,\\n    What would become of you?\\n\\n   I gave her one, they gave him two,\\n    You gave us three or more;\\n   They all returned from him to you,\\n    Though they were mine before.\\n\\n   If I or she should chance to be\\n    Involved in this affair,\\n   He trusts to you to set them free,\\n    Exactly as we were.\\n\\n   My notion was that you had been\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\n   An obstacle that came between\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\\n\\n   Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let him know she liked them best,\\n    For this must ever be\\n   A secret, kept from all the rest,\\n    Between yourself and me.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most important piece of evidence we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the\\nKing, rubbing his hands; \\xe2\\x80\\x98so now let the jury--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98If any one of them can explain it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, (she had grown so large\\nin the last few minutes that she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bit afraid of interrupting\\nhim,) \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give him sixpence. _I_ don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an atom of\\nmeaning in it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \\xe2\\x80\\x98SHE doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an\\natom of meaning in it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no meaning in it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, \\xe2\\x80\\x98that saves a world of\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to find any.

(Which he\\ncertainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98All right, so far,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, and he went on muttering over\\nthe verses to himself: \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the jury, of\\ncourse--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d why, that must be what he\\ndid with the tarts, you know--\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98But, it goes on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTHEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Why, there they are!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts\\non the table. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBEFORE SHE\\nHAD THIS FIT--\\xe2\\x80\\x9d you never had fits, my dear, I think?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 he said to the\\nQueen.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Never!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as\\nit lasted.)\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Then the words don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t FIT you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the King, looking round the court\\nwith a smile. There was a dead silence.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pun!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Let the jury consider their verdict,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the King said, for about the\\ntwentieth time that day.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98No, no!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Stuff and nonsense!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice loudly. \\xe2\\x80\\x98The idea of having the\\nsentence first!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Hold your tongue!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the Queen, turning purple.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Off with her head!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\nmoved.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Who cares for you?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this\\ntime.) \\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re nothing but a pack of cards!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Wake up, Alice dear!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said her sister; \\xe2\\x80\\x98Why, what a long sleep you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve\\nhad!\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had such a curious dream!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said Alice, and she told her\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures\\nof hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had\\nfinished, her sister kissed her, and said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98It WAS a curious dream,\\ndear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting late.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So\\nAlice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\\n\\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her\\nwonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and\\nthis was her dream:--\\n\\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking\\nup into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that\\nqueer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\\nWOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to\\nlisten, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\\nof her little sister\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dream.\\n\\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\naround it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\nLizard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\nTurtle.\\n\\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\nwould change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shrill\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\\nknew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\\nof the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nheavy sobs.\\n\\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and\\nmake THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even\\nwith the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\\nall their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\\n\\n              THE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Alice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 11-0.txt or 11-0.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/11/\\n\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.

U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n'"
